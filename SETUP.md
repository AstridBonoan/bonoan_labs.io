# Bonoan Labs Website - Setup Guide

## Initial Setup Instructions

After cloning this project, follow these steps to get your website fully functional:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Formspree (Contact Form)

The contact form won't work until Formspree is configured:

1. Visit https://formspree.io
2. Click "Create" or sign up if needed
3. Create a new form project
4. You'll be given a **Form ID** (looks like: `mleafyqy`)
5. Open `src/components/ContactForm.tsx`
6. Find line ~26 with the fetch URL
7. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual Form ID

**Example:**
```typescript
// Before:
const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID', {

// After:
const response = await fetch('https://formspree.io/f/mleafyqy', {
```

**Test it:**
- Run `npm run dev`
- Fill out and submit the contact form
- Check the Formspree dashboard to verify submissions are coming through

### 3. Update Social Media Links

Edit `src/components/Footer.tsx` and update the URLs:

```typescript
const socials = [
  {
    name: 'Instagram',
    url: 'https://instagram.com/your-username',  // ← Update this
    // ...
  },
  {
    name: 'Facebook',
    url: 'https://facebook.com/your-page',       // ← Update this
    // ...
  },
  {
    name: 'LinkedIn',
    url: 'https://linkedin.com/company/your-company',  // ← Update this
    // ...
  },
  {
    name: 'Twitter',
    url: 'https://twitter.com/your-handle',      // ← Update this
    // ...
  },
];
```

### 4. Customize Your Content

#### Hero Section (About)
Edit `src/components/Hero.tsx`:

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import GitHub repo into Vercel
3. Vercel automatically configures for Vite
4. Deploy on every GitHub push

#### GitHub Pages
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to GitHub Pages
```

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

#### Traditional Hosting

# Upload dist/ folder to your web server
```

## Customization Guide

### Change Colors
Edit `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      dark: {
        bg: "#0f172a",      // Dark mode background
        card: "#1e293b",    // Dark mode cards
        text: "#e2e8f0",    // Dark mode text
      },
      light: {
        bg: "#ffffff",      // Light mode background
        card: "#f1f5f9",    // Light mode cards
        text: "#0f172a",    // Light mode text
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Change Fonts
Edit `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    fontFamily: {
      sans: ["YourFont", "system-ui", "sans-serif"],  // Change this
    },
  },
}
```

### Add New Sections
Create a new component in `src/components/` and import it in `App.tsx`:

```typescript
// src/components/MyNewSection.tsx
export function MyNewSection() {
  return (
    <section id="my-section" className="py-20 px-4">
      {/* Your content */}
    </section>
  );
}

// Then in App.tsx, add:
import { MyNewSection } from './components/MyNewSection'

// And in the JSX:
<MyNewSection />
```

### Update Navbar Links
Edit `src/components/Navbar.tsx` and modify the section IDs and labels in the navigation.
